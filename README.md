# ESP32S3RemoteWebDebugger
 
A Web-Based Remote Debugging Dashboard for the ESP32-S3 microcontroller, which allows users to upload, debug, and flash firmware via a web browser. 
The core novelty of the system lies in its integration of OpenOCD and GDB debugging protocols into a real-time, browser-accessible interface using Flask and Socket.IO. This setup enables students to initiate and monitor code execution through GDB, issue Telnet commands for memory flashing, and interact with hardware in a way that mimics local USB-based development.
